//! This module defines a set of traits that can be used to plug different measurements (eg.
//! Unix's Processor Time, CPU or GPU performance counters, etc.) into Criterion.rs. It also
//! includes the [WallTime](struct.WallTime.html) struct which defines the default wall-clock time
//! measurement.

/// associated [MeasuredValue](trait.MeasuredValue.html) (eg. if your measurement produces values in
/// nanoseconds, the values passed to the formatter will be in nanoseconds).

/// Implementors are encouraged to format the values in a way that is intuitive for humans and
