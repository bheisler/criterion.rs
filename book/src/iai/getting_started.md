## Getting Started

Iai is designed to be similar in interface to Criterion.rs, so using it is easy. To get started,
add the following to your Cargo.toml file:

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
iai = "0.1"

[[bench]]
name = "my_benchmark"
harness = false
```

Next, define a benchmark by creating a file at `$PROJECT/benches/my_benchmark.rs` with the following contents:

```rust
use iai::{black_box, main};

fn fibonacci(n: u64) -> u64 {
    match n {
        0 => 1,
        1 => 1,
        n => fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2),
    }
}

fn iai_benchmark_short() -> u64 {
    fibonacci(black_box(10))
}

fn iai_benchmark_long() -> u64 {
    fibonacci(black_box(30));
}


iai::main!(iai_benchmark_short, iai_benchmark_long);
```

Finally, run this benchmark with `cargo bench`. You should see output similar to the following:
