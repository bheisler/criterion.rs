# HTML Report

Starting with Criterion.rs 0.4.0 HTML reports must be explicitly enabled via the `html_reports` [feature](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#dependency-features):
```toml
[dev-dependencies]
criterion = {version = "0.4.0", features = ["html_reports"] }
```
Criterion.rs can generate an HTML report displaying the results of the benchmark under
`target/criterion/reports/index.html`. By default, the plots are generated using
[gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) if it is available, or the
[plotters](https://github.com/38/plotters) crate if it is not. The example below was generated
using the gnuplot backend, but the charts generated by plotters are similar.

To see an example report, [click here](html_report/report/index.html). For more details on the
charts and statistics displayed, check the other pages of this book.
